##SBA 308 - Javascript Fundamentals
## Introduction
This project reflects my understanding of basic Javascript principles such as variables, loops, etc.

## Project
Given a dataset, process the data to reflect a student's grades on specific assignments and their overall grade. This required processing multiple arrays containing objects, with certain objects containing smaller arrays and other objects.
 
## Solution
I first of all, created a test case to make sure certain data (such as the course ID and the assignment ID for the course it belongs to) matched, and threw an error if that wasn't the case. Then I produced multiple helper functions to -
1. Reduce the information to the basics needed to reach the end result, the student ID, the assignment ID and the submission information into multiple objects.
2. Process the information further, averaging the scores, removing scores for assignments not due yet and putting all relevant information into another object
3. Modifying the information into the final result object.
